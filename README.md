# nyc-building-energy-efficiency

When walking around the streets of New York City in 2021, something new I noticed since my last visit was how every building had a sign on the front door labelled “Energy Efficiency” with a rating. The rating was from 1 – 100 and each rating had an assigned grade from A through D.

I instantly wondered whether some parts of the city were more likely to have more energy efficient buildings than others and set out to map the energy ratings I found in <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll33_Data_Disclosure_2019-CBL.pdf" target="_blank">this file</a>. Then I used Python (see the ```.ipynb```) to read in, clean and wrangle the data. Check out the final product at ```index.html``` or <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/vivrao/ckp2ms9od3ulp17n39imkbk98.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoidml2cmFvIiwiYSI6ImNqczUxNWF5ZDBhdnE0OXRmb2QwbnEyamYifQ.tIV7H8FUvlke_utWqMeQmg" target="_blank">here</a>.
